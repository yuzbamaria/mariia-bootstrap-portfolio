## Mariia Bootstrap Portfolio website

## Description
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 3, Day 4. 
During Week 3 I learnt Bootstrap library and my task was to apply the skills I got and create a website including the following sections/functionalities:  

1. a Navigation bar:
   - 1.1. include links that are applicable to your portfolio;
   - 1.2. links should navigate to the appropriate sections.
2. a Hero section:
   2.1. a jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
3. a Work section:
   3.1 section displaying your work in grid;
   3.2 use bootstrap cards for each project;
   3.3 the description should give a brief overview of the work;
   3.4 each project will eventually link to your class project work.
4. a Skills section:
   4.1 list out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
5. an About / Contact section:
   5.1 an "About Me" section in the same row.
6. a Footer section:
   6.1 all hyperlinks should have a hover effect;
   6.2 all buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
